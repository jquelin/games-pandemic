=head1 NAME

Games::Pandemic::Card::Special - base class for special pandemic event cards

=head1 VERSION

version 1.111030

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package is the base class for all special event cards in
L<Games::Pandemic>. Nothing really interesting, check the
subclasses instead.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 my $event = $special->event;

Return the special card name, from C<CamelCaseName> to
C<camel_case_name>. This will be used as the event name sent to
main window.

Eg, L<Games::Pandemic::Card::Special::OneQuietNight> objects will return
C<one_quiet_night>.
