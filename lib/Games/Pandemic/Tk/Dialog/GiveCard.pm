=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Games::Pandemic::Tk::Dialog::GiveCard->new(
        parent  => $mw,
        cards   => \@cards,
        players => \@players,
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The game allows player to give cards to each other, provided that the
players are in the same city.

This dialog will show the C<@cards> of current player, with the list of
C<@players> currently in the city. When clicking ok, the selected card
will be given to the selected player. This takes one action, and is
handled by L<Games::Pandemic::Controller>.
