=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Games::Pandemic::Tk::Dialog::DropCards->new(
        parent => $mw,
        player => $player,
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes, a player has too many cards in her hands. In this case, she
must drop cards to get back to the official limit.

This dialog will show current cards of C<$player> and ask which ones
should be discarded. When clicking ok, the selected card(s) will be
dropped. This takes no action, and is handled by
L<Games::Pandemic::Controller>.
