    Games::Pandemic::Tk::Dialog::Forecast->new(
        parent => $mw,

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This dialog implements a dialog to let the user rearrange the next 6
infections in the order she wants when playing a
L<Games::Pandemic::Card::Special::Forecast> card.

The card should be passed in the constructor, along with the player
holding the card.
