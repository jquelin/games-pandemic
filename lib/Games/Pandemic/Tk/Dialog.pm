=head1 NAME

Games::Pandemic::Tk::Dialog - base class for pandemic dialog windows

=head1 VERSION

version 1.111010

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Games::Pandemic::Tk::Dialog> is meant to be used as a base class for
Pandemic dialogs, and should not be used directly.

It will create a new toplevel with the Pandemic icon, a title and
possibly a header.

It accepts the following attributes:

=over 4

=item * parent - the parent window of the dialog, required

=item * title - the dialog title, default to C<Pandemic>

=item * header - a header to display at the top of the window, no default

=back

To subclass it, declare your own attributes, create the lazy builders
for the attributes, C<augment> the C<_build_gui()> method to create the
bottom of the dialog window, and implement the C<_valid()> method that
would be called when ok button is pressed.
