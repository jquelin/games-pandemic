=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Games::Pandemic::Tk::PlayerCards->new( parent=>$mw );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a POE session (aliased C<cards>), responsible to
show the cards hold by the various players. It will receive some events
from the main window when the players gain or loose some cards.
